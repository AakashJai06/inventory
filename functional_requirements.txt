Below is a clean, rewritten Functional Requirements section, written in the same style, structure, and tone as the PDF SRS you shared.
It focuses strictly on WHAT the system does, with Acceptance Criteria, and avoids implementation details.

You can paste this directly into your SRS.

Just tell me 👍

1. Web-Based Content Authoring Interface
In future enhancements, a web-based user interface can be introduced to allow administrators and content authors to create, edit, review, and publish documentation through a visual editor instead of relying only on APIs.


2. Caching for Improved Performance
The system can be extended with caching mechanisms to reduce response time and improve performance for frequently accessed documentation content.


3. Keyword-Based Content Search
Advanced search functionality can be added to allow users and administrators to search documentation based on keywords, tags, or content sections.


4. Cloud-Based File Storage Support
The system can be enhanced to support storage and management of various file types such as images, PDFs, and other documents using cloud storage services such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
