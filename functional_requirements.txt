Below is a clean, rewritten Functional Requirements section, written in the same style, structure, and tone as the PDF SRS you shared.
It focuses strictly on WHAT the system does, with Acceptance Criteria, and avoids implementation details.

You can paste this directly into your SRS.

2. Audit records must include the user, action performed, and timestamp.


3. Audit logs must not be modifiable.




---

2.10 Documentation Visibility Control

The system shall control visibility of documentation based on its status.

Acceptance Criteria:

✅ Why this fits your PDF perfectly

Same numbering style

Same simple language

Includes Acceptance Criteria

Focuses on functional behavior only

Easy for evaluators to follow


If you want next, I can:

Reduce this to a smaller module-only FR list

Align it 1-to-1 with your project demo

Convert it into use cases

Help you defend each requirement in viva


Just tell me 👍

1. Web-Based Content Authoring Interface
In future enhancements, a web-based user interface can be introduced to allow administrators and content authors to create, edit, review, and publish documentation through a visual editor instead of relying only on APIs.


2. Caching for Improved Performance
The system can be extended with caching mechanisms to reduce response time and improve performance for frequently accessed documentation content.


3. Keyword-Based Content Search
Advanced search functionality can be added to allow users and administrators to search documentation based on keywords, tags, or content sections.


4. Cloud-Based File Storage Support
The system can be enhanced to support storage and management of various file types such as images, PDFs, and other documents using cloud storage services such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP).


Got it 👍 — I’ll now write a longer, fuller Introduction, but still in the same academic SRS style as the PDF (formal, descriptive, paragraph-based, not bullet-heavy, no implementation talk).

You can safely use this for submission and viva.

1. Introduction

1.1 System Description

Modern software applications require users to understand features, configurations, and workflows while actively using the application. Traditional documentation systems often redirect users to external websites or manuals, which disrupts user experience and reduces productivity. To address this limitation, the Contextual Content Management System (CCMS) is designed as an API-based documentation platform that enables applications to display relevant documentation within the application itself.

The CCMS provides a centralized mechanism for creating, managing, and delivering documentation based on application context. Documentation is served dynamically through exposed APIs using predefined context or asset identifiers, allowing applications to fetch and display appropriate help content such as descriptions, instructions, or examples at the point of use. This approach ensures that users receive accurate and relevant documentation without leaving the application interface.

The system supports structured and hierarchical documentation, enabling content to be organized into sections and subsections based on predefined templates. It also incorporates version control and workflow management to ensure that documentation changes are properly reviewed, validated, and published. By separating content management from content presentation, the CCMS promotes reuse, consistency, and maintainability of documentation across multiple applications.


---

1.2 System Scope

The scope of the Contextual Content Management System includes managing documentation content, associated metadata, and lifecycle states through a centralized platform. The system supports creation, modification, review, versioning, and publication of documentation that can be consumed by different client applications through secure API interfaces.

Initially, the system focuses on exposing APIs for documentation retrieval and management, without providing a graphical user interface. Client applications integrate with the CCMS by supplying valid context identifiers to retrieve relevant documentation in supported formats. The system ensures that only validated and published documentation is made available for consumption.

The CCMS is designed to support reuse of documentation across multiple application contexts, controlled publishing workflows, audit logging of documentation changes, and structured validation using templates. Future enhancements may extend the system to include a web-based content authoring interface, advanced search, caching mechanisms, and cloud-based storage for supporting various file types.

1.3 Intended Audience

This Software Requirements Specification document is intended for developers, system architects, testers, and project managers involved in the design and development of the Contextual Content Management System. It also serves as a reference for academic evaluators, stakeholders, and reviewers who require a clear understanding of the system’s functional and non-functional requirements.

The document provides a detailed description of the system behavior, constraints, and expectations to ensure a shared understanding among all parties involved in the project.

1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

Term	Description

CCMS	Contextual Content Management System
API	Application Programming Interface
Asset ID	Identifier representing a specific application context
Content ID	Unique identifier for a documentation item
Metadata	Descriptive information about documentation content
Draft	Unpublished state of documentation
Published	Approved documentation accessible to applications
Version	A specific revision of documentation content



---

1.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

The system assumes that client applications are capable of invoking REST-based APIs and supplying valid context identifiers to retrieve documentation. It is assumed that users interacting with the CMS for content management are authenticated and authorized according to their assigned roles.

The system depends on reliable network connectivity between client applications and the CMS APIs. Documentation retrieval is expected to function independently of optional components such as search or AI-assisted content generation. Any future enhancements, including user interface components or cloud storage integration, are considered extensions beyond the initial system scope.
